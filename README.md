# Bee

## Tutorial

We have a `tutorial.pdf` that provides more guidelines to developers who want to use Bee in their projects.

In comparison, Prose also provides a [tutorial](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/prose-framework/#!tutorial). You may compare the difficulties in learning these two frameworks.

## Benchmarks

Please go to `Eval/Benchmarks` for the dataset.

## Implementations For Evaluation

To check the PBE tools used in the evaluation, please go to `Eval`.

The underlying Bee implementation has no plan for open-sourcing now, but we provide a compiled `.dll` and a C\# interface for replication.

## Misc
