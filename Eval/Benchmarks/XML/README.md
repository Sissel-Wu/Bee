# XML Transformation Benchmarks

For `Bee`, the XML information is read from the `.xml` files.
To check the schema used for synthesis, please go to the directory of `XMLBee` project.
The `.csv` files are generated for reference.

The actions are similar to common XML manipulation APIs, e.g., `appendChild`, `deleteElement`, `modifyAttribute`.

The `path_mapping` file is used in Hades to specify the correspondence between flattened paths of the input XML and the paths of the output XML.
