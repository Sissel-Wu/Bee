In the XML transformation domain, the DSL for Prose is from an existing work [Hades](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2908080.2908088).

Please refer to the `README.md` under `FileProse` for more information about Hades.

For the XML transformation domain, the predicates include judgment on XML tags, attributes, and path prefix.
The transformation includes creating new tags, modifying attributes, etc.
